## Usage Guide

When you run the program, you’ll see this menu in terminal:

2. Search specific connections

4. Sort connections by duration
5. Reset search
6. Book a Trip
7. View My Trips
8. Exit

To choose an option, type the number and press Enter.

### View all Connections

Shows a list of all the available train travels— including departure city, arrival city, times, and ticket prices. Use this if you just want to browse what’s available.

### Search specific connections

Lets you find trips that match what you’re looking for based on your filter.
When you choose this option:
1. You’ll be asked to enter what you want to search by (e.g., departureCity, arrivalCity, departureTime, arrivalTime, or daysOfOperation).
2. Then, you’ll be asked to enter a value. Examples:
   - For city searches: type a city name (e.g., Berlin)
   - For time: use hh:mm format (e.g., 09:30)
   - For days: type a day like MON or FRI

If there are matching results, they’ll be shown on screen. If not, you’ll see a message saying no connections were found.

### Sort connections by price

Sorts your current list of results from cheapest to most expensive. Use this if you want to find the most affordable trip. First, you will be prompted to choose First Class Tickets or Second Class Tickets. Then, you will be prompted to choose ascending “asc” or descensing “desc”.

### Sort connections by duration

Sorts the current list of trips from shortest to longest travel time if “asc” or longest to shortest if “desc”. 

### Reset search

Clears any filters or searches you’ve done and shows all connections again. Use this if you want to reset filters or sort.

### Book a Trip
1. Choose a connection by its index number
2. Enter number of travelers
3. For each traveler, provide:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Age
   - ID (Passport/State ID)
   - Class preference (yes/no for First Class)
